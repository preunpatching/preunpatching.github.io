To do that, go to Session options > Accelerator and set it to \"GPU T4 x2\". The runtime may run with just a CPU, however this will cause serious performance degredations compared to with a GPU.\nOnce ready, press Ctrl+Enter, or go to Runtime > Run current cell.\n### Start model\nWhen the notebook asks you to select a compatible Ollama model to use, you may go to https://ollama.com/models to see the library of available models, or use the in-built model search function by leaving the model selection blank. **Be aware that not all models will run on the best free version of the runtime (29 GB RAM, 2x T4 GPU with 32 GB VRAM), so pick the correct model to use!**\n## Bugs\n*   None\n\nOnce done, you're ready to chat with your selected model!\nHave fun!","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check if we're using an Nvidia GPU.\nimport os\nif os.path.isfile(\"/opt/bin/nvidia-smi\"):\n  print(\"Nvidia GPU detected.\")\n  # Install pciutils so that Ollama can auto-detect the Nvidia GPU.\n  !sudo apt install pciutils\nelse:\n  print(\"Couldn't detect Nvidia GPU.

Hmm, this is a classic question that's been around forever. Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about evolution and how species change over time through natural selection. If we consider chickens as a specific species, then there must have been some ancestor that was almost but not quite a chicken. Let's say this ancestor laid eggs, right? Because birds lay eggs. So the idea is that over generations, mutations occurred in these ancestors' DNA.\n\nWait, so if a non-chicken bird had a genetic mutation that made its offspring a chicken, then the first true chicken would have come from an egg laid by a non-chicken parent. That means the egg containing the first chicken would be laid by a different species. Therefore, the egg came before the chicken?\n\nBut hold on, maybe I'm oversimplifying. What defines a chicken? Is it based purely on genetics or also behavior and other traits? Suppose the mutation happened in the zygote inside an egg. So the parent bird was not a chicken, but the offspring inside the egg was. Then that egg is technically a chicken egg because it contains a chicken. But then again, if the eggshell is formed by the mother, maybe the egg's characteristics are from the mother species.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that chickens lay eggs, so without a chicken to lay the egg, there couldn't be an egg. That would mean the chicken came first. But that seems circular because you need a chicken to produce the egg, but where did the first chicken come from?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look into evolutionary biology here. The species we call Gallus gallus domesticus (domestic chicken) evolved from red junglefowl. So over time, there were gradual changes in the genome. A mutation that defines a chicken would have to occur in an embryo inside an egg. That embryo would be the first true chicken, so its parent wasn't quite a chicken yet. Therefore, the egg came first because it was laid by a non-chicken ancestor containing the new genetic traits of a chicken.\n\nBut then another angle: if the definition is about the egg's structure (like hard shells), which birds have had long before chickens existed. So eggs as a reproductive method predate chickens by millions of years. But that's not the point here; the question is specifically between the first chicken and its egg. \n\nWait, maybe there's also a philosophical angle here. The question is often posed to illustrate causality dilemmas. But scientifically, based on evolution, the answer seems to lean toward the egg because the genetic change happened in an embryo inside an egg laid by a predecessor species.\n\nHowever, some might counter that for an egg to be a \"chicken egg,\" it must be laid by a chicken. In that case, then the first chicken would have had to come from a non-chicken egg, which complicates things. But biologists usually classify eggs based on their contents rather than the parent's species. So if the offspring is a chicken, even if the parent isn't, the egg can be considered a chicken egg in that sense.\n\nHmm, I think I need to check some sources or see how this question is typically answered. From what I remember, most scientific explanations say the egg came first because the mutation occurred in the zygote inside an egg laid by an ancestral bird. So the egg containing the first true chicken was laid before the chicken hatched.\n\nAlternatively, there's a discussion about which came first: the chicken or the egg with the shell structure unique to chickens. But again, that might not be necessary here since all birds lay eggs, so chicken-specific features would still require that first mutated embryo in an egg.\n\nAnother thought: If we consider the chicken as defined by its ability to produce a certain kind of egg (maybe with a particular protein like ovalbumin), then the mutation for that protein would have had to occur in the genome. So the first chicken would be the one producing such eggs, but again, that's about laying eggs after being born.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler: The first individual we'd classify as a chicken had parents that were not chickens. Therefore, that first chicken came from an egg laid by non-chicken parents. Hence, the egg (containing the chicken) predates the hatched chicken. So the egg comes first.\n\nYes, that seems to be the consensus in evolutionary terms. The key is understanding that species are defined by gradual changes over generations, so there's no clear line, but if we take a specific mutation as defining a new species, then the egg with that mutation came before the hatched individual.\n</think>\n\nThe question of whether the chicken or the egg came first has been debated for centuries, and the answer hinges on evolutionary biology. Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n1. **Evolutionary Perspective**:  \n   Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) evolved from ancestral species like red junglefowl through gradual genetic changes over millions of years. For a new species to emerge, a mutation must occur that defines it as distinct. \n\n2. **The First Chicken's Origin**:  \n   The first individual we would classify as a \"chicken\" would have hatched from an egg laid by a parent that was not quite a chicken yet (an ancestral bird). This genetic mutation likely occurred in the DNA of a zygote inside an egg, making the embryo the first true chicken. Thus, **the egg containing this mutant embryo came first**.\n\n3. **Philosophical and Biological Definitions**:  \n   - If we define a \"chicken egg\" as one laid by a chicken, then the chicken would need to exist before laying such an egg—a circular argument. However, biologists typically classify eggs based on their contents (the offspring's species), not solely on who laid them.  \n   - Eggs as a reproductive strategy predate chickens by millions of years (all birds lay eggs), but the question specifically concerns the *first* chicken and its egg.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Scientifically, **the egg came first**. The genetic mutation defining a chicken occurred in an embryo inside an egg laid by a non-chicken ancestor. This resolves the paradox: the egg containing the first true chicken predates the hatched individual.\n\nIn summary, evolution provides a clear pathway—genetic changes within eggs over time led to new species, so the first \"chicken\" egg (containing the mutated embryo) emerged before the chicken itself.<think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the egg or the chicken came first.
